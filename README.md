### Executive Summary: Insights & Recommendations
**Top Category Drive Revenue**: Snacks & Eggs, Meat & Fish are the most profitable and high-volume categories. Invest in supply chain and marketing for these.

**Sub-Category Focus**: Noodles and Fish offer consistently high profit margins. Explore bundling offers or featured listings for these.

**Regional Growth Opportunities**: Vellore city dominate revenue

**Seasonal Peaks**: October to December sees spikes in orders‚Äîlikely festive-driven. Stock up and launch promotions in advance.

**Discount Efficiency**: Discount clustering revealed that excessive discounts do not always correlate with increased profit. Optimize discount thresholds to balance competitiveness and margin protection.

**Loss Leaders Identified**: A significant number of Masala products are being sold at a loss due to excessive discounts. These loss leaders have been identified using clustering techniques and exported for targeted action.

**Loss-Making Products**: Categories like Health Drinks and Spices frequently cause losses. Consider cost revaluation, supplier change, or promotional revamp.
